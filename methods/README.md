# ResearchGravity Methods

Invented protocols and strategies for AI research signal detection.

## Available Methods

| Method | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Signal Verification Protocol** | `signal_verification_protocol.md` | Detect truly fresh vs. stale news |

## Usage

Methods are reusable across sessions. Reference them in your research workflow.

```bash
# View available methods
ls methods/

# Apply during session
# Reference protocol steps when capturing signals
```

## Contributing

New methods discovered during research sessions should be:
1. Documented with problem statement
2. Include step-by-step process
3. Provide verification criteria
4. Note anti-patterns to avoid
